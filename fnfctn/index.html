                Title: Skylanders: Dawn of the Dragonides
</p><p> 
</p><p> Story: Dark Spyro, Eon, Mags, and Sprocket engage in an experiment to see what happens when dragon DNA is mixed with that of a human (or other Portal Master) or Skylander, with Eon being the subject. The experiment goes awry, however, and Spyro's darkness is funneled into Eon, while Eon's light is likewise funneled into Spyro. The transformation turns Eon into a purple bipedal dragon, who goes on a rampage eating things, from Mabu to Skylanders to even Superchargers. Spyro, Mags, and Sprocket eventually incapacitate Eon and return him to the lab, where they remove the things he'd eaten from his stomach, and turn him back, returning his light to him and Spyro's darkness to Spyro. One of Eon's victims is the Chronicler, the Mabu that chronicled all that is seen by Portal Masters in Skylanders Academy. He refuses to ever mention the event again, which is why the Portal Masters never heard of it.
