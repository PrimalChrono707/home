                Title: Skylanders: Dawn of Darkness - Chapter 8
</p><p> 
</p><p>Chapter 8: Dawn of Darkness
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl didn’t know what to do with the new power she felt coursing through her veins. Her entire body felt strangely cold, but it wasn’t a cold she disliked. Instead, she enjoyed the chill, thinking it felt more like a pleasant blast of cool air on a hot day rather than the bite of winter. 
</p><p>Strykore turned and approached Kaossandra, and Roller Brawl followed behind a few paces. Strykore placed a hand on his sister-in-law’s shoulder and said, “Kaossandra. So nice to see you again.”
</p><p>Kaossandra pulled her arm out from under his hand, and Roller Brawl noticed that she appeared to be healing. Some of her zombie parts were returning to normal. Odd.
</p><p>Kaossandra, keeping her voice calm, replied, “I can’t say the same, Strykore.” Strykore laughed.
</p><p>“Sure you can,” he said, “you just don’t want to. I get that. Tell me, though: where is my charming brother?” His voice rang with hateful sarcasm. 
</p><p>“Dead,” Roller Brawl muttered behind him. Strykore froze. Then he slowly turned to face her. 
</p><p>“What did you say?” he asked her, his voice tense. Roller Brawl took a deep breath, and repeated herself. 
</p><p>“Dead.”
</p><p>Strykore knelt down on one knee and looked her in the eyes. “Dead, you say?” he said, his face half gleeful, half infuriated. “How do you know this?”
</p><p>“I watched it happen,” Roller Brawl mumbled, only for him to hear, despite knowing that the only others that didn’t need to hear already knew exactly what she was saying. She wasn’t about to be nice to Kaossandra, though. She now realized that she felt no desire to be kind to anyone except Strykore.
</p><p>Roller Brawl took a deep breath and continued. “I was trying to help take out the Darkness and accidentally sent us to another universe. When there, Kaos trapped Eon and his crew in Kaos Traptanium and blew them to smithereens. Good riddance, too,” she finished, her voice slightly raised. She was pleased when Spyro, Cynder, and Kaossandra all gasped at her insult.
</p><p>Strykore’s face looked like it was fighting a full-blown war over being overjoyed or ticked off, and ticked off won. His face assumed an expression of utmost anger, and he straightened. He faced Spyro. 
</p><p>“Why did she free me?” he asked, his voice trembling with rage. “Why were you helping? <em>Tell me everything!</em>” 
</p><p>Cynder flinched at Strykore’s outburst, but Spyro stood his ground. It occurred to Roller Brawl that he must have been used to it. 
</p><p>Spyro took a deep breath. “We needed your help,” he said. “Kaos is forming a new army. Roller Brawl here believed that you were the only thing that could possibly combat that kind of power, and so here we are.”
</p><p>Strykore looked back at Roller Brawl. “What did that nutjob do now?” he asked, ignoring Kaossandra’s offended look. 
</p><p>“He’s building an army of Dark Skylanders,” she replied. “From what I understand, he has everyone except me, Spyro, and Cynder, plus he’s managed to double them somehow.” 
</p><p>Strykore was beyond angry now. His pale face had assumed an ugly red color, and his eyes flashed bloodred. He sighed. “Normally I wouldn’t help the likes of Skylanders,” he said, “especially <em>Spyro</em>. But now that I know that Kaos killed my brother instead of me, not to mention that I can’t take over the world if that fool does first, I suppose I must.” 
</p><p>Spyro and Cynder high-fived each other, and Kaossandra smiled, but Roller Brawl did nothing. She was beginning to wonder if this was a bad idea. Now that she was evil, she loved it. She knew that getting Strykore out was to help good. She was beginning to have second thoughts when a weird voice sounded in her head. 
</p><p><em>You have to follow through, dummy.</em> 
</p><p><em>I don’t want to, though,</em> she thought back. 
</p><p><em>Too bad,</em> the other voice said. <em>You’re committed.</em>
</p><p><em>Committed to what?</em> she asked. <em>Helping the people I no longer like?</em>
</p><p><em>Yes, actually,</em> the voice said. <em>You said you’d help, and now you have to help.</em> 
</p><p><em>I don’t work that way anymore,</em> she shot back. 
</p><p><em>Guess what, nitwit?</em> the voice snapped. <em>I still work that way, and I’m you.</em> 
</p><p>She found that hard to counter. This other voice could only be her, and she and it were one and the same. 
</p><p><em>I’m in control though</em>, she thought, hoping that would work. She felt the other voice smile. 
</p><p><em>Watch</em>, it said. Suddenly, against her will, she felt her body face Spyro and Cynder, saw them return her gaze, and then felt her face break into a genuine, pleased smile. She quickly forced the smile off, and replaced it with a scowl before looking away from the dragons. 
</p><p><em>Cool</em>, she thought. <em>Don’t do that again</em>.
</p><p>All of a sudden, the voice’s presence disappeared, and Roller Brawl heard Kaossandra say, “Don’t do what again?”
</p><p>Mortified to have spoken aloud, she looked at Kaos’s mother and snapped, “None of your business, old lady.”
</p><p>Kaossandra looked hurt, and opened her mouth to respond, but Spyro flew up to her ear and whispered something. Kaossandra closed her mouth, but still looked upset. 
</p><p>“We should get going,” Roller Brawl said. “I don’t know where it is, but we need to go to Arkus.” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Spyro and Cynder, being the only ones present or conscious when they entered the buried castle, were tasked with getting the others out. The half-zombie, the dark overlord, and the evil vampire all followed them. Roller Brawl followed last, separate from the others, thinking. She couldn’t figure out what to do. Her own thoughts were on evil, but that other voice came back, ever nagging, reminding her of her good half. The thing was, she didn’t want to think about her good half. She wanted to forget it. But the other voice wouldn’t let her. The voice was also annoyingly familiar, but she couldn’t place it. 
</p><p>Eventually, the group left the castle’s remains, and the barrage of light nearly blinded her. She squinted and shielded her eyes for a few seconds, but they eventually readjusted. She looked around. 
</p><p>She knew from Spyro’s old stories that the castle used to be hidden in a purple fog, but that was gone now. Instead, what little of the outside parts of the castle could be seen were faded from sunlight. Everything else was underground. The exit they’d just came through was a cave opening. 
</p><p>Spyro faced Roller Brawl. “Why do we need to go to Arkus?” he asked her. 
</p><p>“That’s the only thing I can think to do,” she responded, with a forced calm she couldn’t keep out of her tone. “I know that the Iron Fist is the only thing that can help Strykore take over the world, so why shouldn’t it be powerful enough to stop Kaos?” She finally managed to squeeze some sarcasm in with that last part. 
</p><p>“I suppose it could work,” Spyro said, “silently ignoring the fact that Kaos dropped the Fist the last time it was seen and then Arkus collapsed. Even if the Chompies didn’t find it and start using it as a musical instrument or something and it managed to get back to Arkus, it’s gone anyway.”
</p><p>“You don’t know that,” Roller Brawl retorted, and Strykore interrupted. 
</p><p>“Roller Brawl,” he said. “I think you might have a point, and that yes, we need to go looking for the fist. But arguing pointlessly with dragons will get us nowhere.”
</p><p>“Fine,” she said, not looking at him. 
</p><p>“Good,” he said. “Now all we have to do is get a ship. Is your little Dread-Yacht still available?”
</p><p>“No,” Roller Brawl replied flatly. “Your nephew had it scrapped years ago when he regained control of the Darkness.”
</p><p>“What about any other ships?”
</p><p>“Sharpfin’s ship was also destroyed. In Ninjago.”
</p><p>“Oh,” Strykore said. “Ninjago?”
</p><p>“I’ll tell you later,” Roller Brawl said. 
</p><p>“Alright,” Strykore said, seeing she wasn’t about to continue. “Anything else?”
</p><p>“There is now,” Cynder said. “Now that Roller Brawl is finished yapping about ships that we can’t use, we have a new ship we named the Dread-Yacht, after Flynn’s ship.”
</p><p>For some odd reason, Cynder’s insult cut Roller Brawl like a knife. She tried to tell herself that she didn’t care, but that didn’t stifle the feeling of shame flooding her. <em>Cut it out</em>, she thought. 
</p><p><em>No</em>, the other voice stubbornly said. And it didn’t. 
</p><p>“We’ll carry you,” Cynder said, immediately grabbing Koassandra’s shoulders with her claws and taking to the air. Spyro grabbed Strykore. 
</p><p>“Wait!” Roller Brawl cried, as they flew off. “Where are you going? <em>What about me!?</em>”
</p><p>“The Academy, if you can make it there!” Cynder called back, nastily. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl groaned. “Great,” she said aloud. “I turn evil for <em>twenty minutes</em> and nobody likes me. What’s even the point anymore?”
</p><p>Angrily, she began to skate as close to the island’s edge as she could so that she could teleport to the next one over. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Panting, exhausted from three days of nonstop island hopping, Roller Brawl finally arrived at the Skylander Academy, or lack thereof. 
</p><p>The entire castle that had made up the school was gone. The grounds were bare, every ounce of vegetation torn from its roots. There was a massive bald spot in the earth where she knew the Academy used to stand. Roller Brawl approached the area where the garage used to be, remembering keeping her own car there. Where was it? She’d left it back at the Vampire Clubhouse, but she didn’t know if her brothers and the Tooth Quake would bring it. 
</p><p>A glint of dull bronze caught her eye. Approaching the spot, she found a small, triangular object with two plates embedded into either side. There was a button and four purple lights on the top. She tried to press the button, but it was stuck, so she put the object in her pocket. 
</p><p>Looking around, she saw a massive black pirate ship flying her way. The sails torn, the ship itself looking dilapidated, it quickly flew her way, docking at the edge of the floating island. The gangplank was lowered, and Strykore, Kaossandra (now fully restored somehow), Spyro, and Cynder disembarked. Roller Brawl scowled when she saw them, despite her relief over their arrival. 
</p><p>“I would ask if you’d found a ship instead of a flying piece of crud, but obviously you didn’t,” she quipped, approaching them. Kaossandra’s face went dark at her comment, but Strykore stifled a laugh. Spyro and Cynder’s faces were blank. 
</p><p>“For the record,” Kaossandra snapped, “this was Kaos’s ship from when he went through a pirating phase when you were still a weak, insubordinate cadet, missy. He hasn’t used it in years.”
</p><p>“Okay, jeez,” Roller Brawl said, “I didn't mean to insult your floating trash heap with sails. That was sarcasm, by the way.”
</p><p>Kaossandra rolled her eyes, threw her arms up in irritated surrender, and, turning, walked back to the ship and disappeared inside the cabin. Roller Brawl chuckled, then looked at the others. 
</p><p>“Alrighty, then,” she said. “Who’s ready to go find a magical metal glove and stop a lunatic from taking over the world?” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl chuckled to herself, despite her nausea. Strykore had clearly never flown a flying ship, and while she herself couldn’t lay claim to accomplishing that feat either, Strykore’s flying abilities were awful. To top it off, it had started to rain.
</p><p>“I could breathe underwater better than this guy flies,” she snarked to herself, when Strykore jerked the helm and knocked her off of her feet. “This guy is a terrible pilot.”
</p><p>“Cut the guy some slack,” Cynder said, having obviously heard her snippy comment. “I bet you couldn’t do any better.”
</p><p>“You’re right,” Roller Brawl replied, still struggling to regain her footing. “I couldn’t. Doesn’t change the fact that he’s awful. Besides,” she added, “he corrupted your husband. Doesn’t that make you hate him?”
</p><p>“Yes,” Cynder said. “I do hate him. But that doesn’t stop <em>me</em> from at least being nice.”
</p><p>“Nice is overrated.”
</p><p>Cynder rolled her eyes. “Fine. Think what you will. But for all our sakes, at least pretend to contain your whole evil thing.”
</p><p>“Fine,” Roller Brawl sighed, rolling her eyes. 
</p><p>“Thank you,” Cynder said, sounding unconvinced. She retreated and went to stand with Spyro. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl, watching them quietly converse with each other, was struck with an odd feeling of regret. For a moment, she felt a wave of remorse for being such a snot-head to everyone. Especially Cynder. Out of all of her Skylander Cadet team, she was the first to accept Roller Brawl’s crazy side, despite the fact that Cynder showed up later than the rest of her team. Roller Brawl also kind of missed the days when she actually had a crazy side at all.
</p><p>Roller Brawl quickly shook herself out of her remorseful daze. <em>I don’t have time to be feeling sorry for other people,</em> she thought, <em>let alone myself.</em>
</p><p>|</p>
</p><p>Chapter 9: Nearly a Return to Arkus</p>
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl skated up next to Strykore and watched him struggle to steer the ship. Resisting a smile, she asked him, without looking up, “How goes it? Having problems?”
</p><p>“Somewhat,” Strykore said, chuckling without much humor. “First time for everything.”
</p><p>“I guess,” Roller Brawl said. If there was a first time for everything, was Roller Brawl being evil such a surprise?
</p><p>“Hey,” Strykore said suddenly. “You never told me what Ninjago was.”
</p><p>“No,” she replied, thoughtfully, “I guess I didn’t.” She paused, then continued. 
</p><p>“So,” she said, “years ago, Kaos released the Darkness. The Skylanders – including me – went to fight it, and I, against Eon’s orders, activated the Dark Rift Engine to get rid of it. The connection of dark with dark created a rift that sent my car, Stealth Elf’s helicopter, and Sharpfin’s ship into another universe, called Ninjago. 
</p><p>“There, we found a group of Ninja that were actively fighting against their own dark being, the Overlord. Turns out, the Overlord was sent to Skylands centuries ago and was known here as the Darkness. The rift sent us back into its own timeline, just a couple of decades after its disappearance. 
</p><p>“The battle that followed got Eon and his crew killed, as well as my Skylander teammates, or so I thought. We found evidence that they’d all survived the crashes, but I thought I left them behind in Ninjago. Somehow, Kaos managed to get his hands on them and suck the light from them.”
</p><p>“Did some of that evidence indicate my brother’s survival?” Strykore asked. 
</p><p>“No,” Roller Brawl replied. “He’s dead for sure. Kaos has a duplicate of him, somehow.”
</p><p>“That’s an interesting tale.” Kaossandra had evidently heard Roller Brawl’s story, and came over to participate in the conversation. “But one question: How do you know what Kaos’s plans are? That seems suspicious to me.”
</p><p>“I don’t doubt it,” Roller Brawl replied. “But in Ninjago, I had my head smashed repeatedly into pavement. I suffered some brain damage that the Ninja clearly never fixed, and now I have visions. For a while, they stopped, but now they’ve started back up. I saw Kaos’s army in a vision,” she finished, intentionally neglecting to mention the details of her marriage in the vision with Strykore present. 
</p><p>“Interesting,” Strykore said. 
</p><p>“Technically, I don’t know what his plans are, either,” Roller Brawl then told Kaossandra. “All I know is that he has an army, not what he’s going to use it for.” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>The flight continued smoothly, with no interruptions. Until they stopped in the middle of the sky in the middle of nowhere. 
</p><p>“What’s the holdup?” Roller Brawl asked, returning to the deck after trying and failing to take a nap. “Are we there?”
</p><p>“Technically,” Spyro responded. “We have to open an interdimensional rift to get to Arkus. It’s kind of like how you got to the Land of the Undead during the Supercharger War, remember?”
</p><p>“Yes, Spyro, I do.” Roller Brawl remembered vividly how much of a waste of time fighting Lord Stratosfear was just to get the Thunderous Bolt to even <em>get</em> to the Land of the Undead. Those were some months she wished had never happened; not because she’d be glad that Kaos would be ruling, but simply because it was just annoying. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl turned to Cynder. “You’re sure this is the place?”
</p><p>“Yes, Roller Brawl,” Cynder said, “I’m sure. My psychic location abilities are never wrong. Besides, I’ve been here before.”
</p><p>“Well, excuse my pessimism, Cynder,” Roller Brawl snapped, “which, by the way, was not improved by having the light sucked from my soul.”
</p><p>“It’s not my fault that you did what we specifically told you not to,” Cynder shot back. “Me <em>and</em> Spyro – ” 
</p><p>“Leave me out of this, please,” Spyro muttered.
</p><p>“ – both told you not to sacrifice your light, since you were – are – the best fighting chance we have. So, since I have put up with your antics enough, no, I will not excuse your pessimism, and if Kaossandra and Strykore have no objection, you will <em>not</em> be accompanying us to retrieve the Iron Fist.”
</p><p>Roller Brawl was so taken aback by Cynder’s outburst that she couldn’t even summon the will to blame her own action of bringing Strykore back on Kaossandra, because technically it was her fault, telling Roller Brawl to do it. She stared at Cynder for a moment in disbelief, and then turned and retreated into the cabin of the ship without another word. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Sitting on her bunk bed with her face in her hands, Roller Brawl considered what had just happened. She didn’t know Cynder had such touchy feelings about insults and sarcastic comments. You’d think that knowing her for three and a half years would allow Roller Brawl to learn something like that, but nope. 
</p><p>After several minutes, Roller Brawl felt her hands becoming steadily wet. She looked at them, then felt her face, shocked to discover that she was crying. Why? She could take what Cynder had thrown at her, right?
</p><p><em>Nope,</em> said that no-longer-so-stupid voice in her head. <em>Still a softy.</em> 
</p><p>“I am not,” Roller Brawl said aloud, her own quiet sobs instantly proving her wrong. 
</p><p><em>Yeah, you are.</em> 
</p><p>“Stop it,” Roller Brawl sniffed, attempting defiance, but failing. 
</p><p><em>No, I won’t,</em> the voice said, <em>not until you learn to be nice. Again.</em>
</p><p>“I can’t anymore. You should know this.”
</p><p><em>I don’t think you can’t. I’m you. I’m still here. You can let go of this evil. Do you believe that?</em>
</p><p>Roller Brawl paused, trying to control her breathing. Her lungs were filling and emptying with short, shaky breaths. Forcing herself to take slow, deep breaths, she dried her eye. Slowly, considering her words, she answered the voice’s question: “Yes.”
</p><p>The moment the word left her lips, she felt like an elephant had been taken off of her chest. Gasping as if she was drowning, she once again had to force herself to breathe normally. Once her breathing was under control, she noticed that the voice had vanished. 
</p><p>She thought about her interaction with Cynder, and immediately raced out of the bunk room to apologize. 
</p><p>The second she stepped out onto the deck, the entire ship jerked forward, knocking her off her feet. She flew backward, down the steps, coming to rest on the floor of the hallway connecting the captain’s quarters, the bunks, the kitchen, and the supply closet just as the ship came to a stop. 
</p><p>Getting to her feet, she heard scuffling on the deck above her. Fearful, she bolted back up the steps and burst onto the deck just in time to see a massive black ship fly off, with Strykore, Kaossandra, Spyro, and Cynder on it, all tied together. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl growled in frustration and rage. She knew that ship: It was the kind of ship Kaos had used in his fleet during the Supercharger War. When once he had hundreds, the Skylanders thought they’d destroyed them all. Clearly, they’d managed to let one slip through their grasp. 
</p><p>Despite the fact that her team was now held captive by Kaos, Roller Brawl couldn’t help but chuckle at Kaos’s ridiculous planning skills. Evidently, thinking he’d grabbed everybody, he didn’t bother to consider what he could do with another ship in his arsenal. Which was when it hit her: he might already have more than enough ships in his fleet, and so didn’t need hers. Stealing the Dread Yacht II wasn’t a priority of his… yet. 
</p><p>Panicked, hoping Kaos’s forces didn’t notice she wasn’t with the group of prisoners, she darted up to the helm and fired up the engines. After stuttering a few times, the thrusters finally kicked on, and Roller Brawl steered the Dread Yacht II away from the spot as fast as it could possibly go, in the opposite direction of Kaos’s ship. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Once several miles away, she managed to dock the ship at an island with a couple of mountains, one small forest, and very little else. Hiding the ship in a little cove surrounded by trees, she lowered the plank – not an easy task with only one person – and got off the ship. 
</p><p>Once safe on solid ground, she looked around. The woods around her were extremely dense, and she couldn’t see further than ten feet in. There was a slight breeze, and the sound of wind blowing through miles of leaves was calming. Leaving the ship, hoping that it wasn’t going to get stolen, she caught a glimpse of water as she made to enter the forest. 
</p><p>Pushing through the vines and branches, she didn’t see the pond until she almost fell into it. Grabbing a sapling and holding it so she didn’t stumble and unnecessarily soak herself, she scanned the shore of the pond, finding a blank spot on the other side. The only way to get to it, however, was through the woods surrounding it, and the forest was so dense and the lake so long that she figured it would take hours or maybe even days just to get around. 
</p><p>She looked down at the water below, then at the clear spot. <em>Welp,</em> she thought, <em>I was hoping to not get unnecessarily wet, but now it seems like I have to get necessarily wet.</em> She chuckled at herself. 
</p><p>Hoping her already pathetic swimming skills wouldn’t fail her and cause her to drown, she took a deep breath and plunged into the water. 
</p><p>The pond was ice-cold, so much so that she momentarily froze from the abruptness of the chill. In less than a second, however, she regained control of her body and began to swim the short distance to the other side. 
</p><p>The pond was more of a still river. It was significantly longer than it was wide, with the width being roughly thirty to forty feet. All the same, even while using the flat sides of her sawblade wheels as paddles, she was exhausted by the time she made it to the other side, and figured she might not have been able to make it if the pond hadn’t shallowed out ten feet from the shore. Trudging through the water, sopping wet, and shivering, she reached the bald spot. 
</p><p>Dripping, her clothing as waterlogged as it could possibly be, she collapsed onto the bare ground. She took a deep breath, somehow more tired out by her swim than she thought she’d be. 
</p><p>But she couldn’t, as much as she wished she did, stay here, on the ground. She needed to make a fire, first and foremost, and then find something to eat before the sky, already turning orange, pink, and gold, went completely dark. 
</p><p>Reluctantly, she lifted herself off of the ground and skated to the tree line to gather an armful of dead leaves, dry sticks, and twigs. She carried them back and dumped them in a pile, then gathered large stones from the bank and made a ring around her pile of kindling. Before she lit it, she dragged over large branches, also dead, and used her claws and skates to slice the limbs into large pieces. Finally, ready to drop, she tossed a couple of logs onto the pile and, using the fire she’d absorbed from Spyro, lit it. 
</p><p>After a few minutes of coaxing, she managed to get the fire to ignite the logs. Certain that the fire wasn’t going to go out, she stripped out of her clothes and laid them down on larger stones near the fire to dry out. By now, she was impossibly tired, and she dropped to the ground and fell asleep.
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>She awoke several hours later, when the sky was just beginning to light. The fire had long since died, but at least her clothes were dry. She grabbed her clothes and dressed. 
</p><p>She’d just finished dressing and was putting her helmet back on when she heard a noise. She paused, her arms above her head and her helmet in the air. Dropping the helmet, she skated to the tree line as quietly as she could. Three feet from the nearest bush, she jumped into the underbrush, right on top of a tall, bulky form. 
</p><p>The figure grunted as Roller Brawl landed on his back, and, turning sharply, threw her off of his back. Roller Brawl jumped back to her feet and squared up before realizing who she’d just tackled. 
</p><p>“Raptor!” she cried, relieved that it was just him and not a crazy native stalking her. “How did you find me?”
</p><p>Her oldest brother held up a deep-blue, diamond-shaped stone, about the size of an apple. “This,” he said simply. </p><p>It was the Oracle Gem.
