                Title: Skylanders: Dawn of Darkness - Chapter 8
</p><p> 
</p><p>Chapter 8: Dawn of Darkness
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl didn’t know what to do with the new power she felt coursing through her veins. Her entire body felt strangely cold, but it wasn’t a cold she disliked. Instead, she enjoyed the chill, thinking it felt more like a pleasant blast of cool air on a hot day rather than the bite of winter. 
</p><p>Strykore turned and approached Kaossandra, and Roller Brawl followed behind a few paces. Strykore placed a hand on his sister-in-law’s shoulder and said, “Kaossandra. So nice to see you again.”
</p><p>Kaossandra pulled her arm out from under his hand, and Roller Brawl noticed that she appeared to be healing. Some of her zombie parts were returning to normal. Odd.
</p><p>Kaossandra, keeping her voice calm, replied, “I can’t say the same, Strykore.” Strykore laughed.
</p><p>“Sure you can,” he said, “you just don’t want to. I get that. Tell me, though: where is my charming brother?” His voice rang with hateful sarcasm. 
</p><p>“Dead,” Roller Brawl muttered behind him. Strykore froze. Then he slowly turned to face her. 
</p><p>“What did you say?” he asked her, his voice tense. Roller Brawl took a deep breath, and repeated herself. 
</p><p>“Dead.”
</p><p>Strykore knelt down on one knee and looked her in the eyes. “Dead, you say?” he said, his face half gleeful, half infuriated. “How do you know this?”
</p><p>“I watched it happen,” Roller Brawl mumbled, only for him to hear, despite knowing that the only others that didn’t need to hear already knew exactly what she was saying. She wasn’t about to be nice to Kaossandra, though. She now realized that she felt no desire to be kind to anyone except Strykore.
</p><p>Roller Brawl took a deep breath and continued. “I was trying to help take out the Darkness and accidentally sent us to another universe. When there, Kaos trapped Eon and his crew in Kaos Traptanium and blew them to smithereens. Good riddance, too,” she finished, her voice slightly raised. She was pleased when Spyro, Cynder, and Kaossandra all gasped at her insult.
</p><p>Strykore’s face looked like it was fighting a full-blown war over being overjoyed or ticked off, and ticked off won. His face assumed an expression of utmost anger, and he straightened. He faced Spyro. 
</p><p>“Why did she free me?” he asked, his voice trembling with rage. “Why were you helping? <em>Tell me everything!</em>” 
</p><p>Cynder flinched at Strykore’s outburst, but Spyro stood his ground. It occurred to Roller Brawl that he must have been used to it. 
</p><p>Spyro took a deep breath. “We needed your help,” he said. “Kaos is forming a new army. Roller Brawl here believed that you were the only thing that could possibly combat that kind of power, and so here we are.”
</p><p>Strykore looked back at Roller Brawl. “What did that nutjob do now?” he asked, ignoring Kaossandra’s offended look. 
</p><p>“He’s building an army of Dark Skylanders,” she replied. “From what I understand, he has everyone except me, Spyro, and Cynder, plus he’s managed to double them somehow.” 
</p><p>Strykore was beyond angry now. His pale face had assumed an ugly red color, and his eyes flashed bloodred. He sighed. “Normally I wouldn’t help the likes of Skylanders,” he said, “especially <em>Spyro</em>. But now that I know that Kaos killed my brother instead of me, not to mention that I can’t take over the world if that fool does first, I suppose I must.” 
</p><p>Spyro and Cynder high-fived each other, and Kaossandra smiled, but Roller Brawl did nothing. She was beginning to wonder if this was a bad idea. Now that she was evil, she loved it. She knew that getting Strykore out was to help good. She was beginning to have second thoughts when a weird voice sounded in her head. 
</p><p><em>You have to follow through, dummy.</em> 
</p><p><em>I don’t want to, though,</em> she thought back. 
</p><p><em>Too bad,</em> the other voice said. <em>You’re committed.</em>
</p><p><em>Committed to what?</em> she asked. <em>Helping the people I no longer like?</em>
</p><p><em>Yes, actually,</em> the voice said. <em>You said you’d help, and now you have to help.</em> 
</p><p><em>I don’t work that way anymore,</em> she shot back. 
</p><p><em>Guess what, nitwit?</em> the voice snapped. <em>I still work that way, and I’m you.</em> 
</p><p>She found that hard to counter. This other voice could only be her, and she and it were one and the same. 
</p><p><em>I’m in control though</em>, she thought, hoping that would work. She felt the other voice smile. 
</p><p><em>Watch</em>, it said. Suddenly, against her will, she felt her body face Spyro and Cynder, saw them return her gaze, and then felt her face break into a genuine, pleased smile. She quickly forced the smile off, and replaced it with a scowl before looking away from the dragons. 
</p><p><em>Cool</em>, she thought. <em>Don’t do that again</em>.
</p><p>All of a sudden, the voice’s presence disappeared, and Roller Brawl heard Kaossandra say, “Don’t do what again?”
</p><p>Mortified to have spoken aloud, she looked at Kaos’s mother and snapped, “None of your business, old lady.”
</p><p>Kaossandra looked hurt, and opened her mouth to respond, but Spyro flew up to her ear and whispered something. Kaossandra closed her mouth, but still looked upset. 
</p><p>“We should get going,” Roller Brawl said. “I don’t know where it is, but we need to go to Arkus.” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Spyro and Cynder, being the only ones present or conscious when they entered the buried castle, were tasked with getting the others out. The half-zombie, the dark overlord, and the evil vampire all followed them. Roller Brawl followed last, separate from the others, thinking. She couldn’t figure out what to do. Her own thoughts were on evil, but that other voice came back, ever nagging, reminding her of her good half. The thing was, she didn’t want to think about her good half. She wanted to forget it. But the other voice wouldn’t let her. The voice was also annoyingly familiar, but she couldn’t place it. 
</p><p>Eventually, the group left the castle’s remains, and the barrage of light nearly blinded her. She squinted and shielded her eyes for a few seconds, but they eventually readjusted. She looked around. 
</p><p>She knew from Spyro’s old stories that the castle used to be hidden in a purple fog, but that was gone now. Instead, what little of the outside parts of the castle could be seen were faded from sunlight. Everything else was underground. The exit they’d just came through was a cave opening. 
</p><p>Spyro faced Roller Brawl. “Why do we need to go to Arkus?” he asked her. 
</p><p>“That’s the only thing I can think to do,” she responded, with a forced calm she couldn’t keep out of her tone. “I know that the Iron Fist is the only thing that can help Strykore take over the world, so why shouldn’t it be powerful enough to stop Kaos?” She finally managed to squeeze some sarcasm in with that last part. 
</p><p>“I suppose it could work,” Spyro said, “silently ignoring the fact that Kaos dropped the Fist the last time it was seen and then Arkus collapsed. Even if the Chompies didn’t find it and start using it as a musical instrument or something and it managed to get back to Arkus, it’s gone anyway.”
</p><p>“You don’t know that,” Roller Brawl retorted, and Strykore interrupted. 
</p><p>“Roller Brawl,” he said. “I think you might have a point, and that yes, we need to go looking for the fist. But arguing pointlessly with dragons will get us nowhere.”
</p><p>“Fine,” she said, not looking at him. 
</p><p>“Good,” he said. “Now all we have to do is get a ship. Is your little Dread-Yacht still available?”
</p><p>“No,” Roller Brawl replied flatly. “Your nephew had it scrapped years ago when he regained control of the Darkness.”
</p><p>“What about any other ships?”
</p><p>“Sharpfin’s ship was also destroyed. In Ninjago.”
</p><p>“Oh,” Strykore said. “Ninjago?”
</p><p>“I’ll tell you later,” Roller Brawl said. 
</p><p>“Alright,” Strykore said, seeing she wasn’t about to continue. “Anything else?”
</p><p>“There is now,” Cynder said. “Now that Roller Brawl is finished yapping about ships that we can’t use, we have a new ship we named the Dread-Yacht, after Flynn’s ship.”
</p><p>For some odd reason, Cynder’s insult cut Roller Brawl like a knife. She tried to tell herself that she didn’t care, but that didn’t stifle the feeling of shame flooding her. <em>Cut it out</em>, she thought. 
</p><p><em>No</em>, the other voice stubbornly said. And it didn’t. 
</p><p>“We’ll carry you,” Cynder said, immediately grabbing Koassandra’s shoulders with her claws and taking to the air. Spyro grabbed Strykore. 
</p><p>“Wait!” Roller Brawl cried, as they flew off. “Where are you going? <em>What about me!?</em>”
</p><p>“The Academy, if you can make it there!” Cynder called back, nastily. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl groaned. “Great,” she said aloud. “I turn evil for <em>twenty minutes</em> and nobody likes me anymore. What’s even the point anymore?”
</p><p>Angrily, she began to skate as close to the island’s edge as she could so that she could teleport to the next one over. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Panting, exhausted from three days of nonstop island hopping, Roller Brawl finally arrived at the Skylander Academy, or lack thereof. 
</p><p>The entire castle that had made up the school was gone. The grounds were bare, every ounce of vegetation torn from its roots. There was a massive bald spot in the earth where she knew the Academy used to stand. Roller Brawl approached the area where the garage used to be, remembering keeping her own car there. Where was it? She’d left it back at the Vampire Clubhouse, but she didn’t know if her brothers and the Tooth Quake would bring it. 
</p><p>A glint of dull bronze caught her eye. Approaching the spot, she found a small, triangular object with two plates embedded into either side. There was a button and four purple lights on the top. She tried to press the button, but it was stuck, so she put the object in her pocket. 
</p><p>Looking around, she saw a massive black pirate ship flying her way. The sails torn, the ship itself looking dilapidated, it quickly flew her way, docking at the edge of the floating island. The gangplank was lowered, and Strykore, Kaossandra (now fully restored somehow), Spyro, and Cynder disembarked. Roller Brawl scowled when she saw them, despite her relief over their arrival. 
</p><p>“I would ask if you’d found a ship instead of a flying piece of crud, but obviously you didn’t,” she quipped, approaching them. Kaossandra’s face went dark at her comment, but Strykore stifled a laugh. Spyro and Cynder’s faces were blank. 
</p><p>“For the record,” Kaossandra snapped, “this was Kaos’s ship from when he went through a pirating phase when you were still a weak, insubordinate cadet, missy. He hasn’t used it in years.”
</p><p>“Okay, jeez,” Roller Brawl said, “I didn't mean to insult your floating trash heap with sails. That was sarcasm, by the way.”
</p><p>Kaossandra rolled her eyes, threw her arms up in irritated surrender, and, turning, walked back to the ship and disappeared inside the cabin. Roller Brawl chuckled, then looked at the others. 
</p><p>“Alrighty, then,” she said. “Who’s ready to go find a magical metal glove and stop a lunatic from taking over the world?” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl chuckled to herself, despite her nausea. Strykore had clearly never flown a flying ship, and while she herself couldn’t lay claim to accomplishing that feat either, Strykore’s flying abilities were awful. To top it off, it had started to rain.
</p><p>“I could breathe underwater better than this guy flies,” she snarked to herself, when Strykore jerked the helm and knocked her off of her feet. “This guy is a terrible pilot.”
</p><p>“Cut the guy some slack,” Cynder said, having obviously heard her snippy comment. “I bet you couldn’t do any better.”
</p><p>“You’re right,” Roller Brawl replied, still struggling to regain her footing. “I couldn’t. Doesn’t change the fact that he’s awful. Besides,” she added, “he corrupted your husband. Doesn’t that make you hate him?”
</p><p>“Yes,” Cynder said. “I do hate him. But that doesn’t stop <em>me</em> from at least being nice.”
</p><p>“Nice is overrated.”
</p><p>Cynder rolled her eyes. “Fine. Think what you will. But for all our sakes, at least pretend to contain your whole evil thing.”
</p><p>“Fine,” Roller Brawl sighed, rolling her eyes. 
</p><p>“Thank you,” Cynder said, sounding unconvinced. She retreated and went to stand with Spyro. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl, watching them quietly converse with each other, was struck with an odd feeling of regret. For a moment, she felt a wave of remorse for being such a snot-head to everyone. Especially Cynder. Out of all of her Skylander Cadet team, she was the first to accept Roller Brawl’s crazy side, despite the fact that Cynder showed up later than the rest of her team. Roller Brawl also kind of missed the days when she actually had a crazy side at all.
</p><p>Roller Brawl quickly shook herself out of her remorseful daze. <em>I don’t have time to be feeling sorry for other people,</em> she thought, <em>let alone myself.</em>
