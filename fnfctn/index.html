                Chapter 7: 
________________________________________
Spyro and Cynder looked like Roller Brawl had just suggested that they both eat a Mabu: Fear for her sanity mixed with disgust.
"<em>WHAT!!</em>"" they both yelped, in unison. 
“You’re joking, right?” Cynder asked. 
“I’m not joking,” Roller Brawl said. “Kaos’s army is far more powerful than we can handle alone. I’m not even sure Strykore will be much help,” she finished, mostly to herself. 
“Roller Brawl,” Spyro said, “he’s evil. How can you possibly expect him to help us when all he wants to do is kill us? We locked him back into his interdimensional rift, remember?”
“No,” Roller Brawl said flatly, “I don’t remember. I wasn’t a major part of that war, I was still training in the Academy.”
Roller Brawl cleared her throat and continued. “Anyway, I think Strykore might help us for a couple of reasons. He hates Master Eon for what Eon did to him, right? Well, Kaos has a dark Eon. I don’t know how, especially since I watched him die before my very eyes, but he does. So, Strykore can get his revenge on the Skylanders, his brother, and his nephew all at once. The only thing we have to do is let him out.”
“The only problem,” Spyro said, forcefully calm, “need I remind you, is that in order to let him out, someone needs to <em><strong>THEIR LIGHT EATEN!!!</strong></em>” Spyro shouted this last part in anger, making Roller Brawl’s ears ring. Spyro had a really, really loud voice. 
“Spyro has a point,” Cynder said, rubbing her own ears, having received the full blast of Spyro’s outburst dead on, as she was standing right next to him. “Even if we were to let Strykore out, who’s going to give up their light and every ounce of good they possess to do it?”
There was silence, then Spyro spoke up. “I’ve done it before, and mostly managed to contain my evil,” he said, slowly. “I suppose if anyone – “
“Absolutely not,” Cynder said immediately. “You are not going to go through that again. Not on my watch. If anyone’s doing it, it’ll be me.”
“Why you?” Roller Brawl asked. “It should really be me, since neither of you two seem to be able to bear the thought of having the other try to kill them.” 
“You know what?” Cynder said. “Why don’t we just figure out how to use Kaos’s mom’s Book of Dark Magic that’s hanging over the pedestal over there, and then we can cross the ‘who’s-going-to-get-their-light-sucked-out-to-free-an-ancient-evil’ bridge when we get to it. Deal?”
“Deal,” Roller Brawl and Spyro echoed. They all three then turned to the altar, where Kaossandra’s book was hovering, and stared at it. 
The book was floating at least 6 inches above the pedestal below it. It had a glowing, pulsing purple aura around it, a sign that its power hadn’t dwindled in the however-many years it had been sitting here. Its likewise purple cover was devoid of anything indicating age –  mold, scratches, even dust – and looked like it had just been used less than an hour before, as it was clean, polished, and well-cared for. The only indication of age or use was the yellowed pages. On the cover was an ominous-looking design: an odd shape similar to the form of cloak Kaossandra used to wear with a diamond beneath it. 
Slowly, the three approached the book. All of them seemed to sense its power; Roller Brawl felt a tingling of fear crawling up her spine as she stared at it. The book’s glow pulsed faster and harder as they approached, as if it was agitated by the three sets of eyes unable to look away from it. 
Roller Brawl reached the pedestal and paused. She’d almost forgotten about her friends’ presences when Spyro reached a foot forward to grab the book. Less than an inch away from touching it, a long bolt of electricity, looking almost like a claw, shot out and zapped Spyro in the chest, just above his heart. Spyro was held where he was for long, agonizing seconds before the lightning shot back into the book, and Spyro dropped to the cave’s floor.
Roller Brawl and Cynder dropped to the floor with him, panicking, to check and make sure he was alive. After a few seconds, he coughed, opened his eyes, and sat up.
“Whew!” he said. “That hurt!”
Seeing Spyro was alright, and helping him back to his feet, Roller Brawl turned back to the pedestal. Rather than looking at the book, however, she inspected the altar itself. The altar’s condition was the opposite of the book’s, covered in scratches and cracks. Around the edge of the surface, she noticed an inscription. The letters were faded, but she could still kind of read them. 
“ ‘<em>Only those,</em>’ ” she read aloud, “ ‘<em>who have seen…</em>’ can’t tell what that word is… ‘<em>may remove this book from the surface to which it is bound.</em>’ Spyro?” she said. “Can you tell what this last word is?”
Spyro limped over to where she stood, and peered at the pedestal where she was pointing. “Umm…” he said, his nose almost touching the altar. “I think it says… ‘<em>the darkness,</em>’ but it’s hard to tell.”
“Well, that’s great,” Roller Brawl said. “The only one here who’s actually done that is you, Spyro, and since you can’t touch it, none of us can.”
________________________________________
There was a stunned silence. Then Spyro said, “Well… that’s not <em>entirely true</em>.” Roller Brawl and Cynder looked at him, and he continued. “Technically, we’ve all seen the darkness.”
“What does that mean?” Cynder asked. 
“Well,” Spyro said, “Roller Brawl’s seen Kaos… seen her… seen things that the Darkness brought about.” Roller Brawl appreciated Spyro’s effort to not mention the deaths of the main crew that Roller Brawl couldn’t have stopped.
“I myself have been turned dark before,” Spyro continued, “and Cynder’s father is Malefor. It’s a possibility that all of us individually can’t take the book, but if we all try at once, maybe we can get it.”
Roller Brawl considered Spyro’s words. “We can try,” she said, frowning in thought. “I hate to point out the obvious, but if it doesn’t work, we’ll be even further in the dark than we were.”
Spyro nodded. “I know.”
There was another pause, and then, as one, all three of them reached for the book. Their hands stopped mere inches from the book, and Roller Brawl spoke. 
“On three,” she said. “One… two… three!”
All at once, Roller Brawl, Spyro, and Cynder grabbed for the book. Roller Brawl felt the soft leather cover under her fingers, and tensed, her eyes closed, expecting to be zapped into oblivion. After several long seconds, she opened one eye and glanced at the book. Its glowing seal was gone, and she and the two dragons were all gripping it. She saw the dragon couple hesitantly open their own eyes, and all of them sighed with relief. Slowly, they pulled the book away from the pedestal and set it gently on the floor.
Roller Brawl, as the dragons stepped back, flipped open the front cover to see if the book contained a table of contents. It didn’t. Muttering something about cursed books never having a table of contents in them so that the good guys could find things easier, she began fanning through the pages, looking for something that she could read, let alone something to release Strykore. 
Her irritation grew. Everything in here was written in Arkeyan, the ancient language of Arkus. The Academy, for some reason, had never taught Skylanders to read it, despite how much the Skylanders seemed to run into it. The letters were too confusing to try to pronounce. 
Her anger reaching a peak, she finally slammed the book closed and rose to her feet, beginning to pace around the chamber. Her mind was blank; she couldn’t think of a single helpful thing. She only thoughts were frustration at being denied the only method of victory over Kaos’s new army. 
Her furious ponderings were interrupted by Spyro, who had opened the book and was searching through it. He called Roller Brawl over.
Once by his side, he showed her a page. It was a spell, thankfully spelled in the Common Tongue, and was titled, “Amphibimorphosis.” 
“What’s that do?” she asked no one. “Turn you into a frog?”
“Yes, actually,” Spyro said. “<em>I-way ommand-cay ee-thay e-bay urned-tay into-way – </em>“
“<strong>STOP!</strong>” Roller Brawl cried. “None of us are any help to the plan if we’re frogs!”
“Sorry,” Spyro said sheepishly, ceasing the incantation at once. 
“Just keep looking,” Cynder said, “and stop trying to turn us into frogs.”
Spyro turned the page, and Roller Brawl saw two more spells written in Common. “ ‘Return of the Dark,’ ” she said, “and ‘Dawn of Darkness.’ ”
“Interesting names,” Cynder said. “Which do you think it is?”
“Not sure,” Spyro said, looking at the spells thoughtfully. “It could really be either, I guess.”
“I would imagine,” Roller Brawl said, “that ‘Return of the Dark’ is the one we want. After all, it’s not like Strykore hasn’t been out before.”
Roller Brawl grabbed the book without waiting for a response. She glanced at the dragons, but neither of them tried to stop her. She looked at the page, and began to recite the incantation. 
“<em>Nopu dnammoc fo siht lleps</em>,” she said, “<em>eht daed llahs nekcawaer. Eh ohw sah nellaf gniod eht krow fo eht krad llahs eb detnarg efil wena</em>.
She finished with “That was really hard to pronounce.”
For a moment, nothing happened. Fearful that the spell hadn’t worked, and irritated that she might have to do it again, she closed the book and put it down so she wouldn’t accidentally destroy it in a temper. The moment the book touched the ground, the cave began to quake. 
At the other end of the cave, behind the altar, the cave floor began moving. The earth floor split, and rose upward. Her bones cold, Roller Brawl watched in fear as a form emerged. 
It was Kaossandra. And she was dead.
The form was just as thin and tall as its former self, with tears in its rotting clothing and skin. The zombified woman stood tall, looked Roller Brawl dead in the eye, and started toward her. 
Roller Brawl wanted to assume her standard defensive stance, but her body was frozen in fear. All she could do was watch as the figure strode to her. 
Kaossandra reached Roller Brawl. Instead of attacking her, to Roller Brawl’s surprise, she dropped to one knee in a bow. Kaossandra then straightened, and nodded at Spyro and Cynder. Then she spoke. 
“Thank you,” she said, “for bringing me back.”
Her voice, long unused, was deep and gravelly. Roller Brawl figured that her vocal cords were starting to wither. 
Roller Brawl finally found her own voice. “How…” she stuttered. “How are you dead? Why didn’t the spell open the rift? I’m so confused!”
Kaossandra frowned, or as best as she could with half of her face missing. “Why were you trying to open a rift with my book?” she asked. 
Roller Brawl hesitated. Then she decided to tell the truth. “We were… we’re trying to brink Strykore back.”
Kaossandra was stunned. “Why?!” she cried. “Why… just why?!”
Before Roller Brawl could speak, Spyro said, “Because apparently your son has created an army of dark Skylanders, and they can’t be stopped without him.”
The zombie was taken aback. “How – ”
“Forget that,” Roller Brawl said. “All that matters is that your son refused your pleas to be good, and even went so far as to corrupt your brother, Master Eon.”
Kaossandra nodded, resigning herself to the fact that new events that she was unaware of had happened, and she could figure them out later. “All I can say,” she said, “is that you used the wrong spell. ‘Return of the Dark’ was designed in case the owner of the book died, and so someone could bring them back. ‘Dawn of Darkness’ specifically is the spell used to allow Strykore to see into our world, or half-exit his own. When used by someone who wishes to free him, it will pull the light from their body and soul and bring him back completely.
“I am extremely disappointed in Kaos,” she continued, almost to herself. “He showed up to my castle however long ago it was and killed me when I tried to help him. Evidently, he destroyed my castle, too.”
Roller Brawl tuned her out, looked back at the book, and reached for it when Kaossandra snatched it away from her. 
“Before you do this,” she warned, “know that Strykore will not take doing good easily, and will likely try to kill you.” 
Spyro said, “He won’t kill someone who’s under his control.”
Roller Brawl looked at him. “What d’you mean? Are you saying you’re going to do this?”
Spyro nodded. “Yes, I am.”
“I told you no!” Cynder shouted. “I told you!”
“I know,” Spyro argued, “but…”
“<strong>NO BUTS!</strong>” Cynder screamed. “<strong>BUTTS ARE FOR SITTING!!</strong>”
Silently, while they were arguing, Kaossandra crept up next to Roller Brawl and whispered, “You should probably do it.”
Roller Brawl looked at her. “Why do you say that?” she whispered back. 
Kaossandra looked at Spyro. “He used to be the strongest Skylander,” she replied, “but I can feel he’s not. I don’t know how, but I sense power in you greater than any mortal has ever possessed.”
Roller Brawl looked at her hands. She felt no stronger than she always had, but she trusted Kaossandra, for reasons she couldn’t explain. 
Roller Brawl, following the zombie’s advice, grabbed back the book and began reciting the incantation. Spyro and Cynder stopped arguing and looked at her, but didn’t seem to be able to stop her. 
“<em>Fklm xlnnzmw ul gsrh hkvoo,</em>” she said, “<em>sv dsl lmxv dzh gizkkvw droo yv uivv.</em>” 
Roller Brawl felt a small tugging in her chest. “<em>Gsv wzip yvrmt, Hgibpliv, hszoo yv ivovzhvw uiln srh kirhlm, zmw zooldvw gl ilzn ztzrm.</em>” 
The pull in her torso grew stronger, almost tugging her into the book itself. “<em>Wzipmvhh hszoo xlmjfvi fmwvi srh ivrtm.</em>”
The moment she finished, the book flew from her hands, floating in midair. Hovering a few feet from her and level with her chest, the pages began to flap. Above them, an orb of deep, bloodred formed, growing larger and larger. In the center, Roller Brawl saw two crimson eyes watching her. 
As the portal grew, Roller Brawl felt all the warmth leaving her body, as though someone had opened a valve and drained all her light through her toes. What looked like a purple cord of energy grew on her chest and connected her to the portal. 
Roller Brawl felt herself being lifted into the air. The connection was pulling her off of the ground as it sucked all of the good right out of her. 
The portal kept growing. When it had reached an adequate height, the eyes began moving closer. Several long seconds passed, and then a figure emerged. 
Strykore was exactly as she’d remembered him. She’d only seen him once, when he came to the Academy to talk to his brother in a temporary truce, but he hadn’t changed at all. Same black and purple cloak, pale face, dark eye shadows, large nose, and red eyes. His dark blue helmet with its yellow stone in the forehead was also the same. 
The moment he’d fully emerged, the portal behind him shut, the connection was severed, and Roller Brawl dropped to the ground on one knee in front of him. She kept her head bowed, staring at the ground until he spoke. 
“Thank you for freeing me, vampire,” his deep voice said. 
Roller Brawl looked up at his smiling face, and returned the grin. 
“You’re welcome,” she said. 
Then, she added, “Master.”
