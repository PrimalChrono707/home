                Title: Skylanders: Dawn of Darkness - Chapter 8
</p><p> 
</p><p>Chapter 8: Dawn of Darkness
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl didn’t know what to do with the new power she felt coursing through her veins. Her entire body felt strangely cold, but it wasn’t a cold she disliked. Instead, she enjoyed the chill, thinking it felt more like a pleasant blast of cool air on a hot day rather than the bite of winter. 
</p><p>Strykore turned and approached Kaossandra, and Roller Brawl followed behind a few paces. Strykore placed a hand on his sister-in-law’s shoulder and said, “Kaossandra. So nice to see you again.”
</p><p>Kaossandra pulled her arm out from under his hand, and Roller Brawl noticed that she appeared to be healing. Some of her zombie parts were returning to normal. Odd.
</p><p>Kaossandra, keeping her voice calm, replied, “I can’t say the same, Strykore.” Strykore laughed.
</p><p>“Sure you can,” he said, “you just don’t want to. I get that. Tell me, though: where is my charming brother?” His voice rang with hateful sarcasm. 
</p><p>“Dead,” Roller Brawl muttered behind him. Strykore froze. Then he slowly turned to face her. 
</p><p>“What did you say?” he asked her, his voice tense. Roller Brawl took a deep breath, and repeated herself. 
</p><p>“Dead.”
</p><p>Strykore knelt down on one knee and looked her in the eyes. “Dead, you say?” he said, his face half gleeful, half infuriated. “How do you know this?”
</p><p>“I watched it happen,” Roller Brawl mumbled, only for him to hear, despite knowing that the only others that didn’t need to hear already knew exactly what she was saying. She wasn’t about to be nice to Kaossandra, though. She now realized that she felt no desire to be kind to anyone except Strykore.
</p><p>Roller Brawl took a deep breath and continued. “I was trying to help take out the Darkness and accidentally sent us to another universe. When there, Kaos trapped Eon and his crew in Kaos Traptanium and blew them to smithereens. Good riddance, too,” she finished, her voice slightly raised. She was pleased when Spyro, Cynder, and Kaossandra all gasped at her insult.
</p><p>Strykore’s face looked like it was fighting a full-blown war over being overjoyed or ticked off, and ticked off won. His face assumed an expression of utmost anger, and he straightened. He faced Spyro. 
</p><p>“Why did she free me?” he asked, his voice trembling with rage. “Why were you helping? <em>Tell me everything!</em>” 
</p><p>Cynder flinched at Strykore’s outburst, but Spyro stood his ground. It occurred to Roller Brawl that he must have been used to it. 
</p><p>Spyro took a deep breath. “We needed your help,” he said. “Kaos is forming a new army. Roller Brawl here believed that you were the only thing that could possibly combat that kind of power, and so here we are.”
</p><p>Strykore looked back at Roller Brawl. “What did that nutjob do now?” he asked, ignoring Kaossandra’s offended look. 
</p><p>“He’s building an army of Dark Skylanders,” she replied. “From what I understand, he has everyone except me, Spyro, and Cynder, plus he’s managed to double them somehow.” 
</p><p>Strykore was beyond angry now. His pale face had assumed an ugly red color, and his eyes flashed bloodred. He sighed. “Normally I wouldn’t help the likes of Skylanders,” he said, “especially <em>Spyro</em>. But now that I know that Kaos killed my brother instead of me, not to mention that I can’t take over the world if that fool does first, I suppose I must.” 
</p><p>Spyro and Cynder high-fived each other, and Kaossandra smiled, but Roller Brawl did nothing. She was beginning to wonder if this was a bad idea. Now that she was evil, she loved it. She knew that getting Strykore out was to help good. She was beginning to have second thoughts when a weird voice sounded in her head. 
</p><p><em>You have to follow through, dummy.</em> 
</p><p><em>I don’t want to, though,</em> she thought back. 
</p><p><em>Too bad,</em> the other voice said. <em>You’re committed.</em>
</p><p><em>Committed to what?</em> she asked. <em>Helping the people I no longer like?</em>
</p><p><em>Yes, actually,</em> the voice said. <em>You said you’d help, and now you have to help.</em> 
</p><p><em>I don’t work that way anymore,</em> she shot back. 
</p><p><em>Guess what, nitwit?</em> the voice snapped. <em>I still work that way, and I’m you.</em> 
</p><p>She found that hard to counter. This other voice could only be her, and she and it were one and the same. 
</p><p><em>I’m in control though</em>, she thought, hoping that would work. She felt the other voice smile. 
</p><p><em>Watch</em>, it said. Suddenly, against her will, she felt her body face Spyro and Cynder, saw them return her gaze, and then felt her face break into a genuine, pleased smile. She quickly forced the smile off, and replaced it with a scowl before looking away from the dragons. 
</p><p><em>Cool</em>, she thought. <em>Don’t do that again</em>.
</p><p>All of a sudden, the voice’s presence disappeared, and Roller Brawl heard Kaossandra say, “Don’t do what again?”
</p><p>Mortified to have spoken aloud, she looked at Kaos’s mother and snapped, “None of your business, old lady.”
</p><p>Kaossandra looked hurt, and opened her mouth to respond, but Spyro flew up to her ear and whispered something. Kaossandra closed her mouth, but still looked upset. 
</p><p>“We should get going,” Roller Brawl said. “I don’t know where it is, but we need to go to Arkus.” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Spyro and Cynder, being the only ones present or conscious when they entered the buried castle, were tasked with getting the others out. The half-zombie, the dark overlord, and the evil vampire all followed them. Roller Brawl followed last, separate from the others, thinking. She couldn’t figure out what to do. Her own thoughts were on evil, but that other voice came back, ever nagging, reminding her of her good half. The thing was, she didn’t want to think about her good half. She wanted to forget it. But the other voice wouldn’t let her. The voice was also annoyingly familiar, but she couldn’t place it. 
</p><p>Eventually, the group left the castle’s remains, and the barrage of light nearly blinded her. She squinted and shielded her eyes for a few seconds, but they eventually readjusted. She looked around. 
</p><p>She knew from Spyro’s old stories that the castle used to be hidden in a purple fog, but that was gone now. Instead, what little of the outside parts of the castle could be seen were faded from sunlight. Everything else was underground. The exit they’d just came through was a cave opening. 
</p><p>Spyro faced Roller Brawl. “Why do we need to go to Arkus?” he asked her. 
</p><p>“That’s the only thing I can think to do,” she responded, with a forced calm she couldn’t keep out of her tone. “I know that the Iron Fist is the only thing that can help Strykore take over the world, so why shouldn’t it be powerful enough to stop Kaos?” She finally managed to squeeze some sarcasm in with that last part. 
</p><p>“I suppose it could work,” Spyro said, “silently ignoring the fact that Kaos dropped the Fist the last time it was seen and then Arkus collapsed. Even if the Chompies didn’t find it and start using it as a musical instrument or something and it managed to get back to Arkus, it’s gone anyway.”
</p><p>“You don’t know that,” Roller Brawl retorted, and Strykore interrupted. 
</p><p>“Roller Brawl,” he said. “I think you might have a point, and that yes, we need to go looking for the fist. But arguing pointlessly with dragons will get us nowhere.”
</p><p>“Fine,” she said, not looking at him. 
</p><p>“Good,” he said. “Now all we have to do is get a ship. Is your little Dread-Yacht still available?”
</p><p>“No,” Roller Brawl replied flatly. “Your nephew had it scrapped years ago when he regained control of the Darkness.”
</p><p>“What about any other ships?”
</p><p>“Sharpfin’s ship was also destroyed. In Ninjago.”
</p><p>“Oh,” Strykore said. “Ninjago?”
</p><p>“I’ll tell you later,” Roller Brawl said. 
</p><p>“Alright,” Strykore said, seeing she wasn’t about to continue. “Anything else?”
</p><p>“There is now,” Cynder said. “Now that Roller Brawl is finished yapping about ships that we can’t use, we have a new ship we named the Dread-Yacht, after Flynn’s ship.”
</p><p>For some odd reason, Cynder’s insult cut Roller Brawl like a knife. She tried to tell herself that she didn’t care, but that didn’t stifle the feeling of shame flooding her. <em>Cut it out</em>, she thought. 
</p><p><em>No</em>, the other voice stubbornly said. And it didn’t. 
</p><p>“We’ll carry you,” Cynder said, immediately grabbing Koassandra’s shoulders with her claws and taking to the air. Spyro grabbed Strykore. 
</p><p>“Wait!” Roller Brawl cried, as they flew off. “Where are you going? <em>What about me!?</em>”
</p><p>“The Academy, if you can make it there!” Cynder called back, nastily. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl groaned. “Great,” she said aloud. “I turn evil for <em>twenty minutes</em> and nobody likes me. What’s even the point anymore?”
</p><p>Angrily, she began to skate as close to the island’s edge as she could so that she could teleport to the next one over. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Panting, exhausted from three days of nonstop island hopping, Roller Brawl finally arrived at the Skylander Academy, or lack thereof. 
</p><p>The entire castle that had made up the school was gone. The grounds were bare, every ounce of vegetation torn from its roots. There was a massive bald spot in the earth where she knew the Academy used to stand. Roller Brawl approached the area where the garage used to be, remembering keeping her own car there. Where was it? She’d left it back at the Vampire Clubhouse, but she didn’t know if her brothers and the Tooth Quake would bring it. 
</p><p>A glint of dull bronze caught her eye. Approaching the spot, she found a small, triangular object with two plates embedded into either side. There was a button and four purple lights on the top. She tried to press the button, but it was stuck, so she put the object in her pocket. 
</p><p>Looking around, she saw a massive black pirate ship flying her way. The sails torn, the ship itself looking dilapidated, it quickly flew her way, docking at the edge of the floating island. The gangplank was lowered, and Strykore, Kaossandra (now fully restored somehow), Spyro, and Cynder disembarked. Roller Brawl scowled when she saw them, despite her relief over their arrival. 
</p><p>“I would ask if you’d found a ship instead of a flying piece of crud, but obviously you didn’t,” she quipped, approaching them. Kaossandra’s face went dark at her comment, but Strykore stifled a laugh. Spyro and Cynder’s faces were blank. 
</p><p>“For the record,” Kaossandra snapped, “this was Kaos’s ship from when he went through a pirating phase when you were still a weak, insubordinate cadet, missy. He hasn’t used it in years.”
</p><p>“Okay, jeez,” Roller Brawl said, “I didn't mean to insult your floating trash heap with sails. That was sarcasm, by the way.”
</p><p>Kaossandra rolled her eyes, threw her arms up in irritated surrender, and, turning, walked back to the ship and disappeared inside the cabin. Roller Brawl chuckled, then looked at the others. 
</p><p>“Alrighty, then,” she said. “Who’s ready to go find a magical metal glove and stop a lunatic from taking over the world?” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl chuckled to herself, despite her nausea. Strykore had clearly never flown a flying ship, and while she herself couldn’t lay claim to accomplishing that feat either, Strykore’s flying abilities were awful. To top it off, it had started to rain.
</p><p>“I could breathe underwater better than this guy flies,” she snarked to herself, when Strykore jerked the helm and knocked her off of her feet. “This guy is a terrible pilot.”
</p><p>“Cut the guy some slack,” Cynder said, having obviously heard her snippy comment. “I bet you couldn’t do any better.”
</p><p>“You’re right,” Roller Brawl replied, still struggling to regain her footing. “I couldn’t. Doesn’t change the fact that he’s awful. Besides,” she added, “he corrupted your husband. Doesn’t that make you hate him?”
</p><p>“Yes,” Cynder said. “I do hate him. But that doesn’t stop <em>me</em> from at least being nice.”
</p><p>“Nice is overrated.”
</p><p>Cynder rolled her eyes. “Fine. Think what you will. But for all our sakes, at least pretend to contain your whole evil thing.”
</p><p>“Fine,” Roller Brawl sighed, rolling her eyes. 
</p><p>“Thank you,” Cynder said, sounding unconvinced. She retreated and went to stand with Spyro. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl, watching them quietly converse with each other, was struck with an odd feeling of regret. For a moment, she felt a wave of remorse for being such a snot-head to everyone. Especially Cynder. Out of all of her Skylander Cadet team, she was the first to accept Roller Brawl’s crazy side, despite the fact that Cynder showed up later than the rest of her team. Roller Brawl also kind of missed the days when she actually had a crazy side at all.
</p><p>Roller Brawl quickly shook herself out of her remorseful daze. <em>I don’t have time to be feeling sorry for other people,</em> she thought, <em>let alone myself.</em>
</p><p>|</p>
</p><p>Chapter 9: Nearly a Return to Arkus</p>
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl skated up next to Strykore and watched him struggle to steer the ship. Resisting a smile, she asked him, without looking up, “How goes it? Having problems?”
</p><p>“Somewhat,” Strykore said, chuckling without much humor. “First time for everything.”
</p><p>“I guess,” Roller Brawl said. If there was a first time for everything, was Roller Brawl being evil such a surprise?
</p><p>“Hey,” Strykore said suddenly. “You never told me what Ninjago was.”
</p><p>“No,” she replied, thoughtfully, “I guess I didn’t.” She paused, then continued. 
</p><p>“So,” she said, “years ago, Kaos released the Darkness. The Skylanders – including me – went to fight it, and I, against Eon’s orders, activated the Dark Rift Engine to get rid of it. The connection of dark with dark created a rift that sent my car, Stealth Elf’s helicopter, and Sharpfin’s ship into another universe, called Ninjago. 
</p><p>“There, we found a group of Ninja that were actively fighting against their own dark being, the Overlord. Turns out, the Overlord was sent to Skylands centuries ago and was known here as the Darkness. The rift sent us back into its own timeline, just a couple of decades after its disappearance. 
</p><p>“The battle that followed got Eon and his crew killed, as well as my Skylander teammates, or so I thought. We found evidence that they’d all survived the crashes, but I thought I left them behind in Ninjago. Somehow, Kaos managed to get his hands on them and suck the light from them.”
</p><p>“Did some of that evidence indicate my brother’s survival?” Strykore asked. 
</p><p>“No,” Roller Brawl replied. “He’s dead for sure. Kaos has a duplicate of him, somehow.”
</p><p>“That’s an interesting tale.” Kaossandra had evidently heard Roller Brawl’s story, and came over to participate in the conversation. “But one question: How do you know what Kaos’s plans are? That seems suspicious to me.”
</p><p>“I don’t doubt it,” Roller Brawl replied. “But in Ninjago, I had my head smashed repeatedly into pavement. I suffered some brain damage that the Ninja clearly never fixed, and now I have visions. For a while, they stopped, but now they’ve started back up. I saw Kaos’s army in a vision,” she finished, intentionally neglecting to mention the details of her marriage in the vision with Strykore present. 
</p><p>“Interesting,” Strykore said. 
</p><p>“Technically, I don’t know what his plans are, either,” Roller Brawl then told Kaossandra. “All I know is that he has an army, not what he’s going to use it for.” 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>The flight continued smoothly, with no interruptions. Until they stopped in the middle of the sky in the middle of nowhere. 
</p><p>“What’s the holdup?” Roller Brawl asked, returning to the deck after trying and failing to take a nap. “Are we there?”
</p><p>“Technically,” Spyro responded. “We have to open an interdimensional rift to get to Arkus. It’s kind of like how you got to the Land of the Undead during the Supercharger War, remember?”
</p><p>“Yes, Spyro, I do.” Roller Brawl remembered vividly how much of a waste of time fighting Lord Stratosfear was just to get the Thunderous Bolt to even <em>get</em> to the Land of the Undead. Those were some months she wished had never happened; not because she’d be glad that Kaos would be ruling, but simply because it was just annoying. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl turned to Cynder. “You’re sure this is the place?”
</p><p>“Yes, Roller Brawl,” Cynder said, “I’m sure. My psychic location abilities are never wrong. Besides, I’ve been here before.”
</p><p>“Well, excuse my pessimism, Cynder,” Roller Brawl snapped, “which, by the way, was not improved by having the light sucked from my soul.”
</p><p>“It’s not my fault that you did what we specifically told you not to,” Cynder shot back. “Me <em>and</em> Spyro – ” 
</p><p>“Leave me out of this, please,” Spyro muttered.
</p><p>“ – both told you not to sacrifice your light, since you were – are – the best fighting chance we have. So, since I have put up with your antics enough, no, I will not excuse your pessimism, and if Kaossandra and Strykore have no objection, you will <em>not</em> be accompanying us to retrieve the Iron Fist.”
</p><p>Roller Brawl was so taken aback by Cynder’s outburst that she couldn’t even summon the will to blame her own action of bringing Strykore back on Kaossandra, because technically it was her fault, telling Roller Brawl to do it. She stared at Cynder for a moment in disbelief, and then turned and retreated into the cabin of the ship without another word. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Sitting on her bunk bed with her face in her hands, Roller Brawl considered what had just happened. She didn’t know Cynder had such touchy feelings about insults and sarcastic comments. You’d think that knowing her for three and a half years would allow Roller Brawl to learn something like that, but nope. 
</p><p>After several minutes, Roller Brawl felt her hands becoming steadily wet. She looked at them, then felt her face, shocked to discover that she was crying. Why? She could take what Cynder had thrown at her, right?
</p><p><em>Nope,</em> said that no-longer-so-stupid voice in her head. <em>Still a softy.</em> 
</p><p>“I am not,” Roller Brawl said aloud, her own quiet sobs instantly proving her wrong. 
</p><p><em>Yeah, you are.</em> 
</p><p>“Stop it,” Roller Brawl sniffed, attempting defiance, but failing. 
</p><p><em>No, I won’t,</em> the voice said, <em>not until you learn to be nice. Again.</em>
</p><p>“I can’t anymore. You should know this.”
</p><p><em>I don’t think you can’t. I’m you. I’m still here. You can let go of this evil. Do you believe that?</em>
</p><p>Roller Brawl paused, trying to control her breathing. Her lungs were filling and emptying with short, shaky breaths. Forcing herself to take slow, deep breaths, she dried her eye. Slowly, considering her words, she answered the voice’s question: “Yes.”
</p><p>The moment the word left her lips, she felt like an elephant had been taken off of her chest. Gasping as if she was drowning, she once again had to force herself to breathe normally. Once her breathing was under control, she noticed that the voice had vanished. 
</p><p>She thought about her interaction with Cynder, and immediately raced out of the bunk room to apologize. 
</p><p>The second she stepped out onto the deck, the entire ship jerked forward, knocking her off her feet. She flew backward, down the steps, coming to rest on the floor of the hallway connecting the captain’s quarters, the bunks, the kitchen, and the supply closet just as the ship came to a stop. 
</p><p>Getting to her feet, she heard scuffling on the deck above her. Fearful, she bolted back up the steps and burst onto the deck just in time to see a massive black ship fly off, with Strykore, Kaossandra, Spyro, and Cynder on it, all tied together. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl growled in frustration and rage. She knew that ship: It was the kind of ship Kaos had used in his fleet during the Supercharger War. When once he had hundreds, the Skylanders thought they’d destroyed them all. Clearly, they’d managed to let one slip through their grasp. 
</p><p>Despite the fact that her team was now held captive by Kaos, Roller Brawl couldn’t help but chuckle at Kaos’s ridiculous planning skills. Evidently, thinking he’d grabbed everybody, he didn’t bother to consider what he could do with another ship in his arsenal. Which was when it hit her: he might already have more than enough ships in his fleet, and so didn’t need hers. Stealing the Dread Yacht II wasn’t a priority of his… yet. 
</p><p>Panicked, hoping Kaos’s forces didn’t notice she wasn’t with the group of prisoners, she darted up to the helm and fired up the engines. After stuttering a few times, the thrusters finally kicked on, and Roller Brawl steered the Dread Yacht II away from the spot as fast as it could possibly go, in the opposite direction of Kaos’s ship. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Once several miles away, she managed to dock the ship at an island with a couple of mountains, one small forest, and very little else. Hiding the ship in a little cove surrounded by trees, she lowered the plank – not an easy task with only one person – and got off the ship. 
</p><p>Once safe on solid ground, she looked around. The woods around her were extremely dense, and she couldn’t see further than ten feet in. There was a slight breeze, and the sound of wind blowing through miles of leaves was calming. Leaving the ship, hoping that it wasn’t going to get stolen, she caught a glimpse of water as she made to enter the forest. 
</p><p>Pushing through the vines and branches, she didn’t see the pond until she almost fell into it. Grabbing a sapling and holding it so she didn’t stumble and unnecessarily soak herself, she scanned the shore of the pond, finding a blank spot on the other side. The only way to get to it, however, was through the woods surrounding it, and the forest was so dense and the lake so long that she figured it would take hours or maybe even days just to get around. 
</p><p>She looked down at the water below, then at the clear spot. <em>Welp,</em> she thought, <em>I was hoping to not get unnecessarily wet, but now it seems like I have to get necessarily wet.</em> She chuckled at herself. 
</p><p>Hoping her already pathetic swimming skills wouldn’t fail her and cause her to drown, she took a deep breath and plunged into the water. 
</p><p>The pond was ice-cold, so much so that she momentarily froze from the abruptness of the chill. In less than a second, however, she regained control of her body and began to swim the short distance to the other side. 
</p><p>The pond was more of a still river. It was significantly longer than it was wide, with the width being roughly thirty to forty feet. All the same, even while using the flat sides of her sawblade wheels as paddles, she was exhausted by the time she made it to the other side, and figured she might not have been able to make it if the pond hadn’t shallowed out ten feet from the shore. Trudging through the water, sopping wet, and shivering, she reached the bald spot. 
</p><p>Dripping, her clothing as waterlogged as it could possibly be, she collapsed onto the bare ground. She took a deep breath, somehow more tired out by her swim than she thought she’d be. 
</p><p>But she couldn’t, as much as she wished she did, stay here, on the ground. She needed to make a fire, first and foremost, and then find something to eat before the sky, already turning orange, pink, and gold, went completely dark. 
</p><p>Reluctantly, she lifted herself off of the ground and skated to the tree line to gather an armful of dead leaves, dry sticks, and twigs. She carried them back and dumped them in a pile, then gathered large stones from the bank and made a ring around her pile of kindling. Before she lit it, she dragged over large branches, also dead, and used her claws and skates to slice the limbs into large pieces. Finally, ready to drop, she tossed a couple of logs onto the pile and, using the fire she’d absorbed from Spyro, lit it. 
</p><p>After a few minutes of coaxing, she managed to get the fire to ignite the logs. Certain that the fire wasn’t going to go out, she stripped out of her clothes and laid them down on larger stones near the fire to dry out. By now, she was impossibly tired, and she dropped to the ground and fell asleep.
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>She awoke several hours later, when the sky was just beginning to light. The fire had long since died, but at least her clothes were dry. She grabbed her clothes and dressed. 
</p><p>She’d just finished dressing and was putting her helmet back on when she heard a noise. She paused, her arms above her head and her helmet in the air. Dropping the helmet, she skated to the tree line as quietly as she could. Three feet from the nearest bush, she jumped into the underbrush, right on top of a tall, bulky form. 
</p><p>The figure grunted as Roller Brawl landed on his back, and, turning sharply, threw her off of his back. Roller Brawl jumped back to her feet and squared up before realizing who she’d just tackled. 
</p><p>“Raptor!” she cried, relieved that it was just him and not a crazy native stalking her. “How did you find me?”
</p><p>Her oldest brother held up a deep-blue, diamond-shaped stone, about the size of an apple. “This,” he said simply. 
</p><p>It was the Oracle Gem.

<p>Skylanders: Crystalized - Chapter 1 - Rewrite</p>
</p><p>Chapter 1: The Final Battle? Yeah, Right.
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl pushed harder on the gas pedal, despite the fact that she already had it pressed to the floorboards. Through the rear-view mirror, she saw the road of rift energy being ripped to shreds under her car’s sawblade wheels. Noticing the exposed engine beginning to smoke, Roller Brawl felt a surge of concern, but then quickly told herself it’d all be over in a moment. 
</p><p>Smashing her fist onto the Rift Creator button beside the steering wheel, the Dark Rift Engine within her car opened a portal of swirling golden energy. Ignoring Hex’s protests, Roller Brawl drove into the portal. 
</p><p>The Tomb Buggy emerged on the other end of the portal, and Roller Brawl now felt real panic: <em>Why did the portal take us into the air?!</em> she thought. The Tomb Buggy had reappeared hundreds of feet in the air, aiming right for the ugly, armored face of The Darkness. Frantically spinning the steering wheel, vainly attempting to move the Tomb Buggy off of its course, Roller Brawl screamed (along with The Darkness) as the front of her car smashed into The Darkness…
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>“It is time, Skylanders.” Master Eon’s voice was grave. “The Dark Rift Engine is in our possession, and all we need to do now is get it inside of the Sky Eater and open a rift, so that we can finally send the Darkness back to whatever cursed place it originally came from.”
</p><p>Roller Brawl, along with her teammates Stealth Elf, Knight Mare, and Hex, solemnly nodded. They understood the magnitude of the situation they found themselves in: Defeat The Darkness, or all of Skylands goes <em>bye-bye</em>!
</p><p>Suddenly, something occurred to Roller Brawl. “Umm… Eon?” she hesitantly asked. “What’ll happen if the Dark Rift Engine Plan <em>doesn’t</em> work? What then?”
</p><p>“We can’t think that way, Roller Brawl,” Stealth Elf said, placing a black-gloved hand on Roller Brawl’s shoulder. “It’s all or nothing now.”
</p><p>Roller Brawl sighed. “Stealth Elf,” she said exasperatedly, “you know I’m not a ‘think of the good stuff’ gal like you. Leave it to the Goth vampire chick to think the world’s gonna end every second of every day,” she finished, half to herself. Stealth Elf shrugged, seeming to give up.
</p><p>Beside Stealth Elf, Knight Mare leaned forward slightly so that she could properly see the vampiric roller skater. “Roller Brawl,” she said patiently, “I understand how you feel.”
</p><p>“No, you don’t,” Roller Brawl half-snapped, half-sighed. “The most you’ve ever had to do was stop some stupid Biclopes from cursing the world. I, on the other hand, not only have all five of my brothers to find, but my parents, too.”
</p><p>“Be lucky you <em>have</em> parents,” Stealth Elf said, indignantly. “I don’t have a clue who mine are.”
</p><p>“ ‘Have parents,’ she says,” Roller Brawl repeated. “Mine are probably dead.”
</p><p>“Hate to break up the sob stories, fellas,” came the extremely egotistical voice of Captain Flynn, “but do I really need to remind you that we have a squat little bald guy to beat down?”
</p><p>Knight Mare nodded. “Indeed we do, Captain Flynn,” she said. 
</p><p>Flynn chuckled. “See?” he said to Cali, who stood next to him. “<em>Someone</em> recognizes a good pilot when she sees one.”
</p><p>The Skylanders laughed when Cali simply rolled her eyes. 
</p><p>“Umm… excuse me, Skylanders, but, um, Flynn has a point,” came the uncertain voice of Glumshanks, Kaos’s former servant. “We need to get into the Sky Eater as soon as possible, or Lord Kaos will have all the energy he needs to open his Cataclysmic Mega Rift.”
</p><p>Cali nodded. “Glumshanks is right. But there’s a catch: there’s a forcefield around the Sky Eater that we can’t get through.”
</p><p>Glumshanks looked at Stealth Elf. “You have a helicopter, correct?” he asked. Stealth Elf nodded. “Good,” Glumshanks said. “You can fly over to that geode over there and destroy the crystals inside and outside of it. That should deactivate the forcefield.”
</p><p>Stealth Elf, followed by Knight Mare, jumped into the Stealth Stinger – a large wooden helicopter with miniguns – and quickly blew up the geode. The moment the forcefield was gone, Flynn, at the Dread-Yacht’s helm, followed Stealth Elf inside the mouth of the Sky Eater. 
</p><p>It was time to end this, once and for all. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Hundreds of Drow, a baby Hydra, and a dangerous car chase with massive magic Kaos fists later, the Skylanders and Eon’s crew finally entered the Sky Eater’s control room, pushing the Dark Rift Engine with them. Roller Brawl, catching a glimpse of something in the middle of the room, stopped short, staring in awe and fear.
</p><p>“Nice lava lamp,” Flynn said. “It’s kinda cool. Although, it’s totally giving me the stink eye.” 
</p><p>Surrounded by what looked like large clumps of Petrified Darkness, a magical crystal capable of rendering anything who touched it evil, was a large, swirling, purple, black, and red tornado. Roller Brawl swore she could almost hear it talking. 
</p><p>“Umm…” Glumshanks’ voice was filled with fear. “That’s… The Darkness.”
</p><p>“Good,” Cali said, pulling a lever on the Dark Rift Engine. The Engine began to whir as it turned on. “Now we can finally send it back to where it came from.”
</p><p>Suddenly, from both nowhere and also everywhere, came the sound of maniacal laughter. Down from the ceiling floated a throne spurting large flames from the top. Perched on the throne was Kaos. Roller Brawl didn’t recognize what he was wearing: a long black robe, old-timey shoes, and a bejeweled tiara-crown on his bald head. 
</p><p>“It’s too late, Sky-fools!” Kaos cackled. “The Cataclysmic Mega Rift is almost complete, and soon, I shall be the Ultimate Evil Emperor and Supreme Evil Overlord of Skylands and the Universe! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"
</p><p>Roller Brawl defiantly skated up to the floating throne. “Still as insane as ever, I see,” she humorlessly quipped, staring at Kaos with her face full of rage. 
</p><p>Kaos quit laughing and looked at her. “Roller Brawl?” he said. “That’s you? I don’t recognize you with that DERPY HELMET ON!!” Kaos began cackling again. 
</p><p>Kaos’s laughing only enraged Roller Brawl further. “Bring it on, Kaos,” she snapped, igniting her Fangerangs with a flick of her wrists. “You’ve done enough.”
</p><p>A deep booming voice suddenly sounded from out of nowhere. “Fight them, Kaos,” it said. “Show them the true power of The Darkness!”
</p><p>The Skylanders all gasped as Kaos answered the voice, “Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know.”
</p><p>Quickly bringing his hands up, Kaos used his magic to fling the Skylanders upward and create a platform floating several dozen feet above the control room’s floor. The Skylanders landed on the platform with an unpleasant thump. 
</p><p>“Behold my <em>awesome</em> POWER!” Kaos cried. “Now made even more awesome by THE DARKNESS!”
</p><p>Out of nowhere, Kaos created two large magical hands, that began slamming into the platform, creating waves of glowing pink cubes that came quickly at the Skylanders like sharks (which also happened to be another of Kaos’s favorite attacks from a couple of years previous, as Knight Mare could easily tell you.)
</p><p>“JUMP!!” Roller Brawl yelled, and the Skylanders only barely managed to avoid the first wave when another appeared, and another. Four more waves appeared before Kaos became bored. Both Knight Mare and Roller Brawl had tripped twice, and landed on the waves. Roller Brawl’s legs hurt. A lot. 
</p><p>Kaos then created a massive sword in his magical hands and slammed it into the platform, created more waves of pink cubes. Successfully avoiding this new/old attack, Roller Brawl threw her Fangerangs at Kaos and screamed, “SERIOUSLY?!”
</p><p>The Fangerangs thwacked Kaos in the face and the sword in his magical hands shattered. “NOOO!!! This is IMPOSSIBLE” he yelled. “YOU AREN’T SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO BEAT ME!!”
</p><p>Kaos suddenly disappeared from his throne. “Where did he go?” Stealth Elf cried. 
</p><p>“I don’t know!” Hex yelled in response. 
</p><p>All at once, six Kaoses appeared in a ring, and all of them began shooting pink plasma balls at the Skylanders. Roller Brawl dodged a plasma orb and then noticed something. “The crown!” she yelled to the others. “Hit the one with the crown!”
</p><p>As one, Roller Brawl threw her Fangerangs, Stealth Elf let loose with her wooden minigun, Hex fired a stream of Soul Blasts, and Knight Mare charged with her Dark Traptanium Lance. All four attacks hit the only crowned Koas at once, and all of the other five disappeared. The real Kaos teleported back onto his floating throne. 
</p><p>“ENOUGH!” Kaos roared. He then began tapping the edge of the platform with his magical hands like playing a piano, forming massive pink blocks that rolled toward the Skylanders. Used to these kinds of attacks by now, however, the Skylanders easily avoided them. 
</p><p>Fully enraged by now, Kaos hovered off of his throne and began to charge his magic. Several long moments passed, and then Kaos slammed himself into the platform, creating a ring of the pink-block waves. The Skylanders hopped over this, and then, as one, they all attacked Kaos. Roller Brawl slashed at him with her Fangerangs, Stealth Elf attempted to fill him full of holes, Hex blasted him over and over and over again with her Soul Blasts, and Knight Mare whopped him upside the head with the flat side of her blade. 
</p><p>A large hole broke in the platform beneath Kaos, and he fell screaming to the floor beneath. Panting, Roller Brawl looked at her companions. Then she smiled, and punched the air. “Yes!” she shouted. Stealth Elf and Hex mimicked her, but Knight Mare looked concerned. “That was too easy,” she mumbled. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl ignored her. Quickly deciding that the drop down to the floor below wasn’t going to injure her legs any more than they already were, she jumped through the hole, followed by Hex and Knight Mare. Stealth Elf simply teleported down. “Cheater,” Roller Brawl joked. Stealth Elf lowered her face mask so that Roller Brawl could see her grinning. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl glanced at the motionless form of Kaos before turning to Cali. “Let’s get this show on the road!” she cried, not without cheers of approval from Hex and Stealth Elf. Cali grinned. 
</p><p>“Hit it, Flynn!” she said to the captain, who was the closest to the Engine. 
</p><p>“Alrighty,” Flynn said. “Boom on three: One, two, and… Boom!” Nothing happened. Flynn didn’t press the lever. “Umm… BOOM,” Flynn continued, confused. “Something’s wrong with my BOOM finger!”
</p><p>The same booming voice from earlier reappeared, this time just laughing. Then, Roller Brawl noticed where the voice was coming from. 
</p><p>The Darkness had grown a face. It was deep grey, covered in glowing pink cracks. The eyes were bright pink. The thing’s forehead was huge, and it had a moustache – of all things. 
</p><p>Roller Brawl then noticed that she, like Flynn, was unable to move. She tried and tried, but the only parts of her that she found were still mobile were her mouth and head. So she scowled at The Darkness. 
</p><p>“Impressive, I must say!” The Darkness taunted. “I’m at the brink of complete and total victory, and you’re still fighting! Bravo!”
</p><p>“Woah!” Flynn cried. “The lava lamp talks. That’s awesome!”
</p><p>That moment, the Skylanders, Cali, Flynn, and Glumshanks began floating as The Darkness crept nearer. 
</p><p>“Lord Kaos!” Glumshanks cried. “It’s not too late to stop all this!”
</p><p>The Darkness chuckled. “Foolish troll,” it said. “He answers to me now. Isn’t that right, Kaos?”
</p><p>Kaos leaped from the ground and raised a finger as if to reprimand The Darkness, but thought better of it. He dropped his hand with a sigh. The Darkness chuckled again. 
</p><p>“You see, Glumshanks?” it said. “<em>That’s</em> how you handle your minions.
</p><p>“Finish them off, Kaos,” The Darkness continued. “Show them that The Darkness cannot be defeated!”
</p><p>In response, Kaos began forming a large purple orb of magic and aimed it at the Dark Rift Engine. Roller Brawl heard Flynn say, “Well, Cali, I guess it’s time for you to confess your undying love for me,” to which Cali responded, “Eh. I’m good.” 
</p><p>“Me too,” said Glumshanks. 
</p><p>“Do it, Kaos,” The Darkness persisted. “Do not disappoint me again.”
</p><p>All at once, Kaos’s orb of magic disappeared, and he pushed the Rift Engine’s lever with a malicious chuckle. 
</p><p>Behind the Darkness, a large portal opened and began to suck The Darkness through. “<strong>NO!</strong>” it screamed. “<strong>KAOS! <em>WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?</em></strong>”
</p><p>With a cry of rage, Kaos shouted, “No one tells Kaos what to do except Kaos! And I’m him! And he’s me! And you’re <em>history!!</em>”
</p><p>“<strong>NO!! I WON’T GO BACK! YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS, KAOS!! DO YOU HEAR ME?!?! KAAAOOOOSSSSS!!!!!!!!</strong>” The Darkness’s voice faded as he was pulled through the rift which, with a small <em>pop</em>, disappeared. 
</p><p>The moment the rift vanished, the Sky Eater quaked. Dust trickled from the roof. The place was starting to crumble. 
</p><p>“Time to go!” Roller Brawl said instantly, and, finding she was no longer restrained, skated back the way they had come. Behind her, Cali, Flynn, and the other Skylanders followed. Kaos smacked Glumshanks’s foot and said, “Come, Glumshanks! We’re leaving.”
</p><p>“Right behind you, sir!” Glumshanks shouted gleefully. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Flynn just barely managed to get the Dread-Yacht out of the Sky Eater before the hulking monstrosity exploded from the inside out. Once at a safe distance from the falling wreckage, Flynn gripped Kaos in a hug. “Thanks for helpin’ out the Skylanders, new Kaos buddy!” he said, squeezing the bald “emperor.”
</p><p>Kaos pushed Flynn away from him with an indignant, “Get your filthy, enchilada hands off me, buffoon. I am not your ‘buddy!’”
</p><p>“Right,” Flynn said, still grinning. “Alright, brace yourselves, folks, I think this calls for a <em>super</em>, EPIC, <em>MEGA</em>, <strong><em>BOOM!!!!!</em></strong>” So saying, Flynn hit the thrusters, and the Dread-Yacht took off towards the Skylander Academy at breakneck speed. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>When Flynn finally realized that his speed was going to throw everyone else off of the ship, he slowed the Dread-Yacht’s thrusters. Once she could safely balance again, Roller Brawl skated to Knight Mare, who was working on the Sea Shadow that Nightfall had let her borrow for occasional sea missons. “What did you mean when you said, ‘that was too easy’ earlier?” she asked. 
</p><p>Knight Mare looked grim. “I think we’ve all seen just how hard it’s been in the past to take down Kaos,” she said. “This wasn’t <em>nearly</em> as hard as it was, say, two years ago, when he turned himself into Traptanium.”
</p><p>“You actually have a point,” Stealth Elf said. “It was kind of easy.”
</p><p>Before anyone could say another word, the sky several miles off cracked, and a rift the size of Skylander Academy forced itself open. From this portal, The Darkness reemerged. The shattered Sky Eater began flying with impossible speed and slammed onto The Darkness’s body to construct a suit of armor. The Darkness began to laugh.
</p><p>“You didn’t think this was over, did you?” he taunted the crew on the Dread-Yacht. “This time, it is I who will win. I... am… The Darkness!!”
</p><p>Eon turned to the Skylanders. “Hurry, Skylanders!” he said. “The Darkness is free! Everything you have learned on your journey has prepared you for this moment! You must stop The Darkness, or all of Skylands is doomed! Hurry!”
</p><p>Stealth Elf teleported into her helicopter, and Knight Mare jumped in after her. Activating her chopper’s cannons, Stealth Elf took off toward the Darkness and began to fill it full of holes. Hex jumped into the Tomb Buggy’s gunner seat, and Roller Brawl was about to follow her, when she had an idea. She quickly opened the hood and unplugged the Rift Engine in it. Then, she dragged the Dark Rift Engine to the car and threw it in. In a matter of minutes, she had it all hooked up. Slamming the hood closed, she jumped in the car. 
</p><p>“Roller Brawl! What are you doing?!” Hex, Eon, Cali, and Kaos all said at once. 
</p><p>“The Dark Rift Engine is the only thing that can send that thing back home,” Roller Brawl said, gesturing to The Darkness. “I need to get this engine closer. This is how I’ll do it.” Ignoring the reprimands of Eon, Roller Brawl started the car and took off onto the rift-energy track that the Darkness had created. 
</p><p>________________________________________
</p><p>Roller Brawl pushed harder on the gas pedal, despite the fact that she already had it pressed to the floorboards. Through the rear-view mirror, she saw the road of rift energy being ripped to shreds under her car’s sawblade wheels. Noticing the exposed engine beginning to smoke, Roller Brawl felt a surge of concern, but then quickly told herself it’d all be over in a moment. 
</p><p>Smashing her fist onto the Rift Creator button beside the steering wheel, the Dark Rift Engine within her car opened a portal of swirling golden energy. Ignoring Hex’s protests, Roller Brawl drove into the portal. 
</p><p>The Tomb Buggy emerged on the other end of the portal, and Roller Brawl now felt real panic: <em>Why did the portal take us into the air?!</em> she thought. The Tomb Buggy had reappeared hundreds of feet in the air, aiming right for the ugly, armored face of The Darkness. Frantically spinning the steering wheel, vainly attempting to move the Tomb Buggy off of its course, Roller Brawl screamed (along with The Darkness) as the front of her car smashed into The Darkness. 
</p><p></p>In a nanosecond, the Rift Engine exploded. The combined power of Dark connecting to Dark was too much for the Dark Rift Engine to withstand, and so it’s power pressurized and blew up. In a burst of black and purple energy, the fabric of reality was split, opening another monstrous rift. This portal’s power was so strong, it pulled the Stealth Stinger, the Tomb Buggy, The Darkness, and the Dread-Yacht right into it. The sudden jerk through the air slammed Roller Brawl’s head into the dashboard, and she blacked out.
