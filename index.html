        Welcome to PrimalChrono707.Github.IO! 
        </h1>
        <h2>
            This here page that you - for some reason - decided to stop by and check out is 100% devoted to gaming, or as much of it as I choose to keep up with. 
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Here you will find information on franchises like Skylanders, Five Nights at Freddy's, Minecraft, and more. Check back regularly because you never know when I might create something new and you might miss it! It could be fanart, a song, or even lore information... if you're a nerd that way, like I am! [:
